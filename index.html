            Hi there! I am Emily Reynolds, a budding web developer and technology enthusiast. Born and raised in Omaha, NE, I am a midwestern girl at heart. 
            I recieved a B.S. in Physics from Loyola University of New Orelans in 2015. After gaing a passion for development as a Technical Recruiter, I switched course and began a new career in web development. I specialize in HTML5, CSS, React, Node, Bootstrap and more. I enjoy the satisfaction of web creation and design.
